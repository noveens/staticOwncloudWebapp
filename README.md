## Steps to install:
1. At the owncloud instance you want to communicate with, install this OC App: https://github.com/noveens/cors
2. Now enable the app.
3. Login to the OC instance, Go to settings -> Personal -> Security -> Add domain
4. Add the domain name of the virtual host / localhost you'll be cloning this into (Don't forget to add "http://")
5. Open localhost or the virtual host, and voila.

## Features:
1. The whole webpage is static.
2. The "index.html" will show you all the files at your instance.
3. Each file is clickable, and when clicked shows the file contents.
4. The New File Button at the top right also pops up a text editor to save a file at your OC instance.
